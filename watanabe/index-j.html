<H2>Some Topics</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>ELC project:</B>
Exploring the Limit of Computations (2012.7-2017.3, OW: project leader)<BR>

We investigate various approaches
for understanding <EM>computation</EM>,
in particular, the limitations of computation,
which has not been understood well including the famouse P vs. NP conjecture.

<UL>
<LI>
This project is supported
by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research of the Ministry of Education,
as one of the largest and the most important category.
<LI>
The project consists of more than forty top Japanese researchers
in theory of computation, in particular,
in complexity theory and the design and analysis of algorithms.

<LI>
<B>Comp View project:</B>
Computationism as a Foundation for the Sciences (2009.7-2012.3, OW: project leader)<BR>

We successfully terminated the project,
and we received the highest evaluation by the Global COE evaluation committee.

<UL>
<LI>
This project was selected as
one of the projects
under the
<A HREF="http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-globalcoe/index.html">
Global COE (Center of Excellence) program</A> of Japanese government.
(This program provides funding support
for establishing education and research centers that perform
at the apex of global excellence
to elevate the international competitiveness of the Japanese universities.)
<LI>
We proposed a research program
for establishing a new paradigm or framework of science
that seeks to rethink various scientific phenomena
from the point of view of computation,
which we call the CompView approach.
<LI>
We also made up a doctoral program
for creating specialits of the CompView approach;
those who can pursue this new paradigm.
Our program is to foster doctoral students
to have skills in both high-performance computing
and mathematical modeling/analysis.
